<h2>Welcome to the tutorial</h2>

<h3>The goal</h3>

Blah.
You are expected to be proficient with Ruby or at least to be able to follow
some written code.
No installer, just a simple module. More focused on learning the tools and the
architecture.

<h3>Setting up the environment</h3>
Everything detailed in the "contributing" section of http://yast.github.io

You are expected to use a recent version of openSUSE. Tumbleweed would be even
better.

{% highlight bash %}
zypper install packages-needed-but-not-installed-by-default
{% endhighlight %}


<h3>The method</h3>

Every step is a tag in this repository, so intead of a text with a lot of
chunks of code, you can explore yourself.

In fact, it reflects my own experience developing yast-journal as my first
module.

You are expected to be proficient with git. If it's not the case, it's better to
not change anything, just use your copy to read and create your files everywhere
else.

As a first step, clone the repo.
{% highlight bash %}
git clone bla
{% endhighlight %}

Right after doing this, you can already see how the final result will loook
like.

{% highlight bash %}
cd bla
rake run
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Let's start</h3>
